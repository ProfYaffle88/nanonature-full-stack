</p>

A full-stack project built using the Django framework with; Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I aim to create a functional blog website for terrarium/bonsai/plant enthusiasts.

# About
NanoNature is a website where users can register for an account, create projects, update projects with entries, and comment on updates from other users. This allows users to record long-term projects and share them with other hobbyists. The website is primariliy targeted at a community united around a particular hobby (hereafter referred to as <b>'nano-gardening'</b>), but the format could be easily adjusted to any hobby with visibile progress over time.

# UX
Using the core UX principles I first started with Strategy, thinking about the target audience & the features they would benefit from.

The target audience for NanoNature is:

- Anyone interested in nano-gardening:
  - All ages, genders, abilities
  - All experience levels:
    - Anyone interested in starting out in nano-gardening
    - Anyone interested in sharing their project successes and failures

These users will be looking for:

- A clear and informative website, with intuituve navigation
- A UI/UX that is minimalistic and emphasises the content and theme.
- The ability to make a user account in order to post content and interact with the community.
- The ability to comment on content in order to ask and answer questions.
- The ability to follow creators and projects of interest

Given the desire to appeal to as broad an audience as possible, UX/UI philosophy will be simple with a focus on content and painless navigation.

# Surface

## Design 

Given the desire to appeal to as broad an audience as possible, UX/UI philosophy will be simple with a focus on content. Navigation should be fast and intuitive. Green is the obvious choice for a natural hobby. The style should be simple and plain for maximum content focus. Plain shapes and colours, minimise points and hard corners, fluid & organic.
